## Overview

This implementation showcases sophisticated mathematical techniques crucial for yield curve construction, forward rate modeling, and derivative pricing in quantitative finance.

## Mathematical Foundation

### B-Spline Theory
B-splines (basis splines) are piecewise polynomials defined by a degree k and knot vector t = [t₀, t₁, ..., tₘ]. The B-spline basis functions Bᵢ,ₖ(x) are defined recursively:

#### Recursive Definition (Cox-de Boor)
```
Bᵢ,₀(x) = { 1 if tᵢ ≤ x < tᵢ₊₁
           { 0 otherwise

Bᵢ,ₖ(x) = (x - tᵢ)/(tᵢ₊ₖ - tᵢ) × Bᵢ,ₖ₋₁(x) + (tᵢ₊ₖ₊₁ - x)/(tᵢ₊ₖ₊₁ - tᵢ₊₁) × Bᵢ₊₁,ₖ₋₁(x)
```

#### Spline Function
A B-spline curve S(x) of degree k is expressed as:
```
S(x) = Σᵢ₌₀ⁿ cᵢ × Bᵢ,ₖ(x)
```

where cᵢ are the control points (coefficients) to be determined.

### Mathematical Properties

#### Local Support
B-spline basis functions have **compact support**: Bᵢ,ₖ(x) is non-zero only on [tᵢ, tᵢ₊ₖ₊₁]. This means:
- Changing one coefficient affects only a local region
- Computational efficiency: O(k) operations per evaluation
- Numerical stability: well-conditioned basis matrices

#### Partition of Unity
For any x in the domain: Σᵢ Bᵢ,ₖ(x) = 1

This ensures:
- **Affine Invariance**: Splines preserve straight lines
- **Convex Hull Property**: Curve lies within convex hull of control points
- **Variation Diminishing**: Curve oscillates less than control polygon

#### Smoothness
A B-spline of degree k has Cᵏ⁻ᵐ continuity at knots with multiplicity m:
- **Simple knots** (m=1): Cᵏ⁻¹ continuity
- **Double knots** (m=2): Cᵏ⁻² continuity
- **Full multiplicity** (m=k+1): C⁻¹ discontinuity

### Knot Vector Design

#### Uniform Knots
Equal spacing: tᵢ₊₁ - tᵢ = constant
- Simple implementation
- May not capture data characteristics well

#### Non-Uniform Knots
Variable spacing adapted to data density
- Better approximation properties
- Common in financial applications

#### Boundary Knot Multiplicity
Multiple knots at boundaries (degree k+1) ensure:
- Spline passes through end points
- Control over boundary derivatives
- Proper function domain

### Piecewise Polynomial Representation

#### Power Basis
Each segment expressed as: p(x) = aₙxⁿ + aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a₁x + a₀

#### B-Spline to PP Conversion
Rateslib converts B-splines to piecewise polynomial (PP) form for efficient evaluation:
- **Storage**: Coefficients for each polynomial piece
- **Evaluation**: Direct polynomial evaluation (no basis function computation)
- **Derivatives**: Analytical differentiation of polynomial pieces

## Key Concepts

### Core Classes
- **PPSplineF64**: Double-precision float splines for performance
- **PPSplineDual**: First-order automatic differentiation support
- **PPSplineDual2**: Second-order AD with Hessian information
- **ADOrder**: Controls differentiation level throughout computation

### Spline Construction Process
1. **Knot Vector Definition**: Specify domain and smoothness requirements
2. **Basis Matrix Construction**: Build B-spline evaluation matrix
3. **System Solution**: Solve for coefficients with boundary conditions
4. **PP Conversion**: Convert to piecewise polynomial form

### Boundary Conditions

#### Natural Splines (left_n=0, right_n=0)
Second derivative = 0 at boundaries: S''(x₀) = S''(xₙ) = 0
- Minimizes curvature at ends
- Common for yield curve interpolation
- Smooth extrapolation behavior

#### Clamped Splines (left_n=1, right_n=1)
First derivative specified: S'(x₀) = d₀, S'(xₙ) = dₙ
- Controls tangent at boundaries
- Useful when slope information available
- Better local control

#### Custom Boundary Conditions (left_n=2, right_n=2)
Second derivative specified: S''(x₀) = d₀, S''(xₙ) = dₙ
- Direct curvature control
- Advanced applications (convexity constraints)

## Sections Analysis

### 1. Splines with Automatic Differentiation
```python
pps = PPSplineDual(k=3, t=[0,0,0,4,4,4])  # Cubic spline, degree 3
pps.csolve(tau=[1,2,3], y=[Dual(...), ...], left_n=0, right_n=0)
```

**Mathematical Details**:
- **Degree k=3**: Cubic polynomials, C² continuity
- **Knot vector [0,0,0,4,4,4]**: Triple knots at boundaries for interpolation
- **Domain**: [0, 4] with evaluation points at τ = [1, 2, 3]
- **Boundary conditions**: Natural spline (second derivative = 0 at ends)

**Matrix System**:
The coefficient system Ac = y where:
- A is the B-spline basis matrix evaluated at data points
- c are unknown coefficients
- y are target function values (as Dual numbers for AD)

### 2. Financial Yield Curve Application
```python
spline = PPSplineF64(k=4, t=[timestamps with multiplicity])
```

**Quartic Splines (k=4)** advantages for yield curves:
- **Higher smoothness**: C³ continuity for realistic forward rates
- **Flexibility**: Can model complex yield curve shapes
- **Stability**: Less oscillatory than higher-degree polynomials

**Knot Strategy**:
- **Boundary multiplicity k+1**: Ensures interpolation at endpoints
- **Interior knots**: Match significant yield curve points (2Y, 10Y, 30Y)
- **Temporal scaling**: Knots in timestamp units for numerical stability

### 3. Log-Spline for Discount Factors
Mathematical motivation for log-space interpolation:

#### Positivity Preservation
Standard spline: S(t) might become negative
Log-spline: DF(t) = exp(S_log(t)) > 0 always

#### Forward Rate Smoothness
Forward rate: f(t) = -d/dt log(DF(t)) = -S'_log(t)
- Log-spline ensures smooth forward rates
- Avoids artificial oscillations in implied forwards

#### Implementation
```python
log_spline.csolve(y=[0, log(1.0), log(0.983), log(0.964), 0])
DF(t) = exp(log_spline.ppev_single(t))
```

**Financial Interpretation**:
- **Boundary conditions**: Zero log-discount factor at boundaries
- **Interpolation**: Smooth transition between market data points
- **Forward rates**: f(t) = -d/dt[log-spline evaluation]

### 4. Visualization and Validation
The matplotlib visualization demonstrates:
- **Discount Factor Curve**: Monotonically decreasing (as required)
- **Forward Rate Curve**: Implied instantaneous forward rates
- **Smoothness**: Visual inspection of derivative continuity
