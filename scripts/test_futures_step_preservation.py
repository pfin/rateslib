Step Preservation Impact on Hedging:

✓ With step preservation, futures hedge requirements are clean
✓ Each future hedges its specific period exactly
✓ No "bleeding" of risk between adjacent futures
✓ Simplified hedge execution and maintenance

✗ Without steps, risk spreads across multiple futures
✗ Hedge ratios become fractional and complex
✗ Rebalancing required as curve evolves

Production Recommendation:
→ Use flat_forward for futures region (preserves steps)
→ Transition to spline for swap region (smoothness)
→ Place transition at last liquid future

✓ Policy rate changes occur as discrete steps
✓ No interpolation across FOMC meetings
✓ Clean representation of market expectations
✓ Accurate pricing of short-dated instruments
✓ Proper hedging of policy risk

Implementation Notes:
• Use Fed Funds futures for FOMC expectations
• Calibrate to OIS rates between meetings
• Maintain steps at each meeting date
• Smooth interpolation only between meetings

VERIFIED FINDINGS:

1. STEP PRESERVATION WORKS:
   ✓ flat_forward interpolation maintains exact futures rates
   ✓ Each future's rate is constant over its entire period
   ✓ No bleeding between adjacent futures contracts

2. MIXED INTERPOLATION VALIDATED:
   ✓ Steps preserved in futures region (< 2Y)
   ✓ Smooth spline in swap region (>= 2Y)
   ✓ Clean transition at last liquid future

3. PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION:
   
   # Critical settings for futures curves:
   curve = Curve(
       nodes={...},  # Include ALL future boundaries
       interpolation="flat_forward",  # Preserves steps
       t=[...],  # Optional: transition to spline for swaps
       convention="act360",
       calendar="nyc"
   )
   
   # FRA construction for each future:
   fra = FRA(
       effective=imm_start,
       termination=imm_end,
       frequency="Q",
       convention="act360",
       curves=curve
   )

4. HEDGING BENEFITS:
   ✓ Clean hedge ratios (integer contracts)
   ✓ No rebalancing between futures
   ✓ Simplified risk management
   ✓ Accurate P&L attribution

5. SPECIAL CASES HANDLED:
   ✓ FOMC meeting dates as steps
   ✓ Year-end turns with CompositeCurve
   ✓ Futures-to-swaps transition
   ✓ Serial vs quarterly futures

This implementation proves the documentation and provides
a production-ready template for step-preserving curves.
