# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important File Management Rules

**NEVER create new files unless explicitly asked.** Always prefer modifying existing files:
- If documentation is needed, extend existing docs
- If scripts need enhancement, modify the originals
- If examples are needed, add to existing examples
- Always come up with a plan for file modification first
- Only create new files when specifically requested by the user

## Project Overview

Rateslib is a state-of-the-art fixed income library for Python that provides advanced financial analysis capabilities for interest rates, derivatives, swaps, bonds, and other fixed income instruments. It's a hybrid Python/Rust project using PyO3 for performance-critical components.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (tested with 3.12)
- Rust toolchain (installed via rustup)
- Conda or similar environment manager

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Create conda environment with Python 3.12
conda create -n rateslib-dev python=3.12 -y
conda activate rateslib-dev

# Install Rust if not already installed
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# Install build tools and dependencies
pip install maturin numpy matplotlib pandas pytest coverage ruff mypy pandas-stubs

# Build the Rust extension (from project root)
maturin develop --release
```

### Working Directory Structure
```
rateslib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python/           # Python source code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rateslib/    # Main package
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/       # Test suite
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rust/            # Rust source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml       # Rust configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml   # Python configuration
```

### Running Code Locally

**IMPORTANT**: To work with rateslib locally without installation, you must be in the `python/` directory:

```bash
cd python
python
>>> import rateslib
>>> print(rateslib.__version__)
2.1.0
```

### Testing

**CRITICAL**: Tests MUST be run from the `python/` directory using `python -m pytest` (not just `pytest`). This ensures the local rateslib module can be imported without installation.

#### Prerequisites for Testing
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project root
cd /path/to/rateslib

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate rateslib-dev

# Navigate to the python directory (REQUIRED)
cd python
```

#### Running Tests

##### Basic Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests with default output
python -m pytest tests/

# Run all tests with quiet output (dots only)
python -m pytest tests/ -q

# Run all tests with verbose output (show each test name)
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests with no traceback (useful for clean output)
python -m pytest tests/ --tb=no
```

##### Running Specific Tests
```bash
# Run a specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_curves.py

# Run a specific test class
python -m pytest tests/test_curves.py::TestCurve

# Run a specific test method
python -m pytest tests/test_curves.py::TestCurve::test_interpolation

# Run tests matching a pattern
python -m pytest tests/ -k "test_fx"

# Run specific test directory
python -m pytest tests/scheduling/
```

##### Test Collection and Discovery
```bash
# Count total tests without running them
python -m pytest tests/ --collect-only -q | tail -1
# Output: 3758 tests collected

# List all test names without running
python -m pytest tests/ --collect-only -q

# Show test collection tree
python -m pytest tests/ --collect-only
```

#### Coverage Analysis

##### Running Tests with Coverage
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage collection
python -m coverage run -m pytest tests/ -q

# Run specific tests with coverage
python -m coverage run -m pytest tests/test_curves.py
```

##### Coverage Reports
```bash
# Generate terminal coverage report
python -m coverage report

# Show only files with missing coverage
python -m coverage report --skip-covered --skip-empty

# Generate detailed HTML coverage report
python -m coverage html
# Open htmlcov/index.html in browser

# Generate XML coverage report (for CI/CD)
python -m coverage xml

# Show coverage for specific files
python -m coverage report --include="rateslib/curves/*"
```

## Architecture Overview

### Hybrid Python/Rust Design
The codebase uses a hybrid architecture with performance-critical components implemented in Rust and exposed to Python via PyO3:

- **Rust Components** (`rust/`): Core mathematical operations, dual numbers for automatic differentiation, curve interpolation, calendar calculations, and FX rate handling
- **Python Components** (`python/rateslib/`): High-level API, instrument definitions, pricing logic, and user-facing interfaces

### Key Modules

1. **Curves** (`curves/`): Interest rate curve construction and interpolation
   - Base curve classes with caching and state management
   - Multiple interpolation methods (linear, log-linear, cubic spline)
   - Rust-accelerated interpolation functions

2. **Instruments** (`instruments/`): Financial instrument definitions
   - Base classes for all instruments with pricing metrics
   - Specialized modules for bonds, credit derivatives, FX volatility, rates
   - Multi-currency and inflation-linked instruments

3. **Dual Numbers** (`dual/`): Automatic differentiation support
   - Dual and Dual2 types for first and second-order derivatives
   - Full operator overloading and mathematical functions
   - Used throughout for sensitivity calculations

4. **Scheduling** (`scheduling/`): Date generation and calendar logic
   - Business day adjustments and holiday calendars
   - IMM date handling and schedule generation
   - Day count fraction calculations

5. **FX** (`fx/`): Foreign exchange rates and forwards
   - FX rate pairs and conversion logic
   - FX forward curve construction

6. **Legs** (`legs/`): Cash flow leg definitions
   - Fixed, floating, and indexed legs
   - Credit and mark-to-market legs

## Important Design Patterns

1. **State Management**: Classes use `_WithState` and `_WithCache` mixins for efficient caching and state validation
2. **NoInput Pattern**: Uses `NoInput` sentinel values to distinguish unset parameters from None/0 values
3. **Dual Types**: Extensive use of dual numbers for automatic differentiation throughout pricing code
4. **Rust Acceleration**: Performance-critical paths delegated to Rust via PyO3 bindings

- **splines/**: Spline interpolation

All Rust components are exposed via PyO3 bindings and tested through Python test suite.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests organized by module in `python/tests/`
- Separate tests for Python and Rust components (e.g., `test_curves.py` vs `test_curvesrs.py`)
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data
- Financial accuracy tests comparing against known results

## Development Notes

- The project uses maturin for building Python wheels with Rust extensions
- Rust code in `rust/` directory with Python bindings exposed via `rust/lib.rs`
- Type stubs (`.pyi` files) provide type hints for Rust modules
- The codebase follows strict type checking with mypy in strict mode
- Ruff is configured for comprehensive linting with specific rule sets enabled

## Notebooks and Examples

### Jupyter Notebooks
The project includes educational Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory:
- `coding/` - Basic examples demonstrating core functionality
- `coding_2/` - Advanced examples with detailed explanations

**Note**: Some notebooks use private/internal functions (prefixed with `_`) for educational purposes. These are not part of the public API.

### Running Examples

#### As Notebooks
```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter lab
```

#### As Python Scripts
Notebooks have been converted to standalone Python scripts:

```bash
# From the python/ directory
cd python

# Run individual example
python ../scripts/examples/coding_2/Curves.py

# Run all examples with error handling
python ../scripts/run_all_examples.py
```

### Converting Notebooks to Scripts
To convert new notebooks:
```bash
python scripts/convert_notebooks_v2.py
```

This creates executable Python scripts in `scripts/examples/` that can be run without Jupyter.
